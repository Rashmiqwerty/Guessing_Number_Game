...........Game Logic:..........
1. Start by generating a random number (e.g., between 1 and 100).
    Prompt the user to guess the number.
    Compare the user’s guess with the actual number.
    Provide feedback (e.g., “Too high!” or “Too low!”) until the user guesses correctly.
    Limit the number of attempts (e.g., 5 or 10).
2. User Interaction:
    Use input() to get the user’s guess.
    Display messages to guide the user (e.g., "Guess a number: ").
3. Looping and Conditions:
    Use a while loop to keep the game running until the user wins or runs out of attempts.
    Use if statements to check whether the guess is correct or needs adjustment.
